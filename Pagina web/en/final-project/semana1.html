                    <p class="think__details__info__cont">The problem that people have is having few outlets at home in different types of environments, having an excess of loads forces us to use a current extension which helps, but it is not so pleasant and not very safe. So for this project we thought of a device called 360 ° outlet which has several inputs which would help to place multiple plugs and would have greater load capacity, this equipment would also have a device that can automatically turn off the equipment or any type of load connected to the plug this would be powered by a switch. This device would benefit people who have a lot of equipment, it would also help to save space on walls from now on the electrical plan would take into account the measures you would need to place them, it would also look very nice, decorative and very useful.</p>
